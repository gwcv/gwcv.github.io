# Price, Charts, and Market Cap of Bone ShibaSwap (BONE)

## Understanding Bone ShibaSwap (BONE)

Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) is the governance token for the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange (DEX). This token empowers holders to participate in community voting, propose changes, and access future NFTs within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The voting power of each holder is directly proportional to their BONE token balance, creating a decentralized governance model.

As an Ethereum-based token, BONE operates alongside two other prominent tokens in the Shiba ecosystem: **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** and **Doge Killer (LEASH)**. The Shiba Inu project, famously dubbed the "Doge Killer," has emerged as the second-largest dog-themed memecoin in the cryptocurrency space. BONE plays a critical role in this ecosystem, enabling liquidity provision and staking rewards for SHIB holders through the ShibaSwap platform.
