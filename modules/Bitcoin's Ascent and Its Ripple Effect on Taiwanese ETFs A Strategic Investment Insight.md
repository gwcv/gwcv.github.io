# Bitcoin's Ascent and Its Ripple Effect on Taiwanese ETFs: A Strategic Investment Insight

## The Rise of Bitcoin and Its Market Impact

Bitcoin has surged from $20,000 to over $100,000, capturing global investor attention. This meteoric rise has not only redefined cryptocurrency's role in portfolios but also spurred innovative financial products. **BitoPro**, Taiwan's leading crypto exchange, reported a 30% year-on-year increase in crypto conversions via its "Points for Crypto" program with FamilyMart. Users now exchange loyalty points for Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Dogecoin (DOGE), with monthly quotas selling out rapidly. This trend highlights a shift toward democratized crypto access, enabling small investors to enter markets without upfront costs.

3. **Phishing Attacks**: Fake exchange apps stealing wallet credentials

### Fraud Red Flags
