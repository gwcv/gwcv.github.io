## Technical Foundations: Scaling Bitcoin's Limitations  

BCH emerged from Bitcoin's scalability debate, prioritizing **on-chain transaction capacity** over layered solutions. Key technical innovations include:  

1. **Block Size Expansion**:  
   - Increased from Bitcoin's 1MB to 8MB in 2017, later raised to 32MB in 2018.  
   - Enables processing of ~100 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Bitcoin's 7 TPS.  

2. **Transaction Efficiency**:  
   - Average fees remain below $0.01, making BCH ideal for microtransactions and everyday payments.  
   - Confirmation times reduced to ~10 minutes, though not as fast as layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network.  

3. **Security Model**:  
   - Maintains Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus, ensuring robust security despite smaller network hash rate.

## Competitive Landscape: Navigating a Crowded Market  

BCH faces challenges from multiple directions:  

### Direct Bitcoin Competition  
- BTC's "digital gold" narrative attracts institutional investors, while BCH's payment focus targets retail adoption.  
- Lightning Network advancements threaten BCH's low-fee advantage.  

### Smart Contract Platforms  
- Ethereum's dominance in DeFi and NFTs, plus emerging competitors like Solana and Cardano, limit BCH's smart contract capabilities.  

### Payment-Focused Alternatives  
- Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) maintain brand recognition and community support.  
- Stablecoins like USDT offer fee-free transactions with price stability.
