While USDT provides price stability, its value remains at risk if stored improperly. Exchange hacks, phishing scams, and hardware failures have led to significant losses for crypto holders. Cold wallets like Materialâ€™s solution address these concerns by:

2. **Mitigating Exchange Risks**: Avoids risks associated with third-party platforms, including insolvency or regulatory issues.  
3. **Long-Term Durability**: Physical storage withstands environmental threats that digital devices cannot.

Acquire the wallet through Material Cryptoâ€™s official channels. Upon receipt, scan the embedded QR code using a compatible wallet app (e.g., MetaMask) to load your USDT.  

### Step 2: Secure Storage  
Store the wallet in a safe location, such as a bank vault or home safe. Never share your private key or recovery phrase.  

### Step 3: Fund Retrieval  
To access funds:  
1. Connect the wallet to a trusted device using a hardware interface.  
2. Transfer USDT to a hot wallet or exchange via platforms like **Exodus** or **Trust Wallet**.
