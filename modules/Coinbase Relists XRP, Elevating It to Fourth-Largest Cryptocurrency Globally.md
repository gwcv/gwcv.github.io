# Coinbase Relists XRP, Elevating It to Fourth-Largest Cryptocurrency Globally

## XRP Achieves Historic Market Position

In a landmark development for the digital asset sector, Coinbase - America's largest cryptocurrency exchange - has officially relisted Ripple's XRP token. This strategic move comes on the heels of a pivotal legal victory that has reshaped the cryptocurrency landscape. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $0.783 with a staggering 66% surge in the past 24 hours alone, propelling it to claim the fourth position in global market capitalization.

The digital asset's meteoric rise represents a dramatic turnaround from its previous standings between sixth and seventh place over the past two years. This remarkable shift occurred within hours of Coinbase's announcement, as XRP surpassed established players like USD Coin (USDC) and Binance Coin (BNB) in market value, according to CoinMarketCap data.

## Legal Precedent Reshapes Industry Dynamics

The core significance of Ripple's legal victory lies in the court's definitive classification of XRP. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized on social media: "The critical finding is that XRP itself isn't an 'investment contract' under Howey's requirements." This legal distinction carries profound implications, establishing a crucial precedent for cryptocurrency classification.

This ruling represents more than a single company's victory - it sets a regulatory framework that could benefit the entire crypto industry. Garlinghouse characterized the decision as "a watershed moment for crypto," reinforcing Ripple's position that XRP functions as a utility token rather than a security.

The market's enthusiastic response - with XRP's value surging over 65% in a single day - underscores the significance of this legal clarity. Investors and industry participants now operate with greater certainty regarding XRP's status and potential applications.

## FAQ: Understanding the Legal Implications

**Q: What was the key legal ruling regarding XRP?**  
A: The court determined that XRP doesn't qualify as a security under the Howey Test, which defines investment contracts. This distinction removes significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the token.

**Q: How might this affect other cryptocurrencies?**  
A: This precedent creates a clearer pathway for other digital assets to establish non-security status, potentially reducing regulatory burdens across the industry.

## Regulatory Landscape Evolution

While this marks a significant victory, the regulatory battle remains unfinished. The SEC is currently evaluating potential appeals, and the case could eventually reach the Supreme Court. The agency's previous argument centered on XRP qualifying as a security because it was sold to investors expecting profits. However, the court's ruling challenges this framework entirely.

This development could complicate the SEC's approach to regulating other cryptocurrencies. If mere profit expectations no longer automatically classify digital assets as securities, regulators must develop new frameworks to address this evolving market.

## Market Dynamics and Future Outlook

The immediate market reaction demonstrates the interconnected nature of regulatory developments and cryptocurrency valuations. XRP's rapid ascent past established competitors illustrates how quickly market positions can shift with regulatory clarity.

Historical context reveals the dramatic trajectory of XRP's market position:
