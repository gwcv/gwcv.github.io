### 3. **NFT Adoption in Sports Merchandise: Case Studies and Trends**  

The partnership between OKX and Manchester City isnâ€™t an isolated experiment. Major sports organizations, including the NBA and Formula 1, have launched similar initiatives. For example:  
- **NBA Top Shot**: A platform for collecting highlight reels as NFTs, which has generated over $1 billion in sales.
