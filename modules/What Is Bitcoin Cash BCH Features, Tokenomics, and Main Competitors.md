## The Origins of Bitcoin Cash

### A Response to Bitcoin's Scalability Crisis

In 2017, Bitcoin faced critical congestion issues due to its 1MB block size limit. A group of developers and investors, including prominent figures like Roger Ver, proposed increasing block sizes to maintain Bitcoin's viability as a peer-to-peer payment system. This ideological divergence led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash on August 1, 2017, through a hard fork that preserved transaction history while implementing fundamental changes.

### Key Technical Enhancements

BCH's most notable innovation was expanding block sizes from Bitcoin's 1MB to 8MB initially, later increasing to 32MB. This architectural shift enabled:

- **Higher transaction throughput**: Processing capacity grew from ~7 transactions per second (TPS) to over 200 TPS
- **Reduced fees**: Average transaction costs dropped from $50+ during Bitcoin congestion to fractions of a cent
- **Improved scalability**: Larger blocks accommodate growing network demand without compromising decentralization

### Controversy and Market Position

The inclusion of "Bitcoin" in BCH's name sparked debates about branding legitimacy. Despite controversy, BCH achieved significant market success, briefly reaching the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This positioning reflects its enduring relevance in the crypto ecosystem.

## Bitcoin Cash Core Features

### Blockchain Architecture

BCH maintains Bitcoin's foundational principles while introducing critical upgrades:

| Feature                | Bitcoin (BTC) | Bitcoin Cash (BCH) |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Block Size Limit       | 1MB           | 32MB               |
| Transaction Speed      | ~10 minutes   | ~10 minutes        |
| Block Reward Halving   | Every 210k    | Every 210k         |
| Consensus Mechanism    | Proof-of-Work | Proof-of-Work      |
| Smart Contract Support | Limited       | SLP + CashScript   |

### Transaction Processing Capabilities

The increased block size enables BCH to handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) compared to Bitcoin:

- **Bitcoin**: 7 TPS
- **BCH (8MB blocks)**: 116 TPS
- **BCH (32MB blocks)**: 200+ TPS

This scalability makes BCH more practical for everyday transactions and micro-payments.

### Mining Dynamics

BCH's mining ecosystem remains robust despite periodic hash rate fluctuations. The network employs the same SHA-256 algorithm as Bitcoin, allowing miners to switch between chains based on profitability. This flexibility maintains network security through competitive mining incentives.

### Decentralized Infrastructure

BCH preserves Bitcoin's decentralized nature through:

- Open-source development
- Distributed node network
- Community-driven governance
- Transparent ledger system

## Tokenomics and Supply Distribution

### Supply Parameters

BCH shares Bitcoin's capped supply model:

- **Maximum Supply**: 21,000,000 coins
- **Current Circulation**: ~18,500,000 coins (as of 2025)
- **Block Reward Schedule**:
  - Initial: 50 BCH per block
  - Current: 6.25 BCH per block (post-2020 halving)
  - Next Halving: 2024 (estimated)

### Mining Rewards and Halving

The halving mechanism maintains scarcity and controls inflation:

- **Halving Frequency**: Every 657,000 blocks (~4 years)
- **2020 Halving**: 12.5 â†’ 6.25 BCH reward
- **2024 Halving**: 6.25 â†’ 3.125 BCH reward
- **Final Block**: Estimated 2140

### Distribution Analysis

BCH's distribution reflects its fork origin:

- **Initial Airdrop**: All Bitcoin holders received BCH at 1:1 ratio
- **Current Distribution**:
  - Exchanges: 35%
  - Wallets: 60%
  - Mining Pools: 5%

This distribution pattern indicates broad ownership across the crypto community.

## Use Cases and Real-World Applications

### Peer-to-Peer Transactions

BCH's primary purpose remains facilitating direct value transfers with distinct advantages:

- **Lower Fees**: Average $0.001 per transaction vs. BTC's $1-5
- **Merchant Adoption**: Growing acceptance in e-commerce and remittances
- **Micropayments**: Enables new business models through sub-cent transactions

### Token Issuance with SLP
