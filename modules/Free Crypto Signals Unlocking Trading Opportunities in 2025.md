## Mastering Crypto Trading Strategies  

### 1. **Technical Analysis**  
Use tools like candlestick charts and moving averages to validate signals. For example, a bullish engulfing pattern near a support level often aligns with buy recommendations.  

### 2. **On-Chain Data**  
Monitor blockchain metrics (e.g., whale transactions, exchange inflows) to anticipate price movements. CryptET integrates this data for enhanced signal accuracy.  

### 3. **Risk Management**  
Never risk more than 2% of your portfolio on a single trade. Diversify across assets like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **altcoins** to spread risk.  

### 4. **Regulatory Awareness**
