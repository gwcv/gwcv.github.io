### Strategic Framework and Implementation

The approval follows the SFC's 2019 introduction of the "Code on Investment in Virtual Assets by Licensed Corporations," which established comprehensive requirements for managing crypto portfolios. Huobi's successful application demonstrates the firm's ability to meet stringent standards covering:

- Custody solutions for digital assets
- Risk management protocols
- Portfolio diversification requirements
- Transparency obligations
- Investor protection mechanisms

This regulatory greenlight comes at a critical juncture as global markets witness increasing institutional interest in digital assets, exemplified by Canada's recent launch of the world's first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

## Approved Fund Structure and Investment Strategy

Huobi's approved fund offerings represent a diversified approach to crypto asset management:

| Fund Type               | Investment Focus                  | Allocation Strategy         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Bitcoin Tracker Fund    | BTC exposure                      | 100% virtual assets         |

The multi-strategy fund's hybrid approach demonstrates a measured entry into crypto investing, balancing traditional asset classes with emerging digital opportunities. This structure aims to provide both stability and growth potential for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape.
