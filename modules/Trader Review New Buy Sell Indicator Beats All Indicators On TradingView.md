# Trader Review: New Buy Sell Indicator Beats All Indicators On TradingView  

The world of trading just got more exciting with a groundbreaking strategy that combines three powerful tools: **RangeFilterBuyAndSell**, **Liquidity-Adjusted Moving Averages**, and the **MACD**. This innovative approach isnâ€™t just another TradingView indicatorâ€”itâ€™s a game-changer for traders aiming to maximize profits while minimizing risks. Whether youâ€™re a novice or a seasoned investor, this method offers a structured framework to navigate volatile markets with confidence.

## Why This Strategy Stands Out  

Most traders struggle with conflicting signals from individual indicators. By integrating **Liquidity-Adjusted Moving Averages** with the **MACD** and the **RangeFilterBuyAndSell**, this strategy eliminates noise and focuses on high-probability trade setups. Hereâ€™s what makes it unique:  

- **Precision Timing**: Identifies optimal entry/exit points for both bullish and bearish trends.  
- **Adaptability**: Works across multiple timeframes and asset classes (crypto, forex, stocks).  
- **Risk Management**: Built-in mechanisms to protect capital during sudden market reversals.

## Key Components of the Strategy  

### 1. **RangeFilterBuyAndSell**  
This core tool filters out false signals by analyzing price action within dynamic support/resistance zones. It highlights high-probability reversal points with clear buy/sell arrows.  

### 2. **Liquidity-Adjusted Moving Averages**  
Traditional moving averages lag behind price. This upgraded version adjusts for volume spikes, ensuring smoother trend identification even in choppy markets.  

### 3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**  
The MACD confirms trend strength and momentum shifts. When combined with the other two tools, it acts as a final validation layer for trade signals.

## How to Use This Strategy: Step-by-Step  

1. **Apply All Three Indicators**: Load the **RangeFilterBuyAndSell**, **Liquidity-Adjusted MA**, and **MACD** onto your TradingView chart.  
2. **Identify Confluence Zones**: Look for overlapping signals between the tools. For example:  
   - **Buy Signal**: RangeFilter shows a green arrow, Liquidity MA turns bullish, MACD crosses above the signal line.  
   - **Sell Signal**: RangeFilter shows a red arrow, Liquidity MA turns bearish, MACD crosses below the signal line.  
3. **Set Stop-Loss/Take-Profit Levels**:  
   - **Stop-Loss**: Place 5â€“10 pips below the entry candle for buys; above for sells.  
   - **Take-Profit**: Use a 1:2 risk-reward ratio or trail the stop-loss with the Liquidity MA.

| 2025-04-05 | Sell        | $2,320      | $2,180     | -6.0%      |

## Advanced Tips for Maximizing Performance

- **Market Context**: Avoid counter-trend trades during major news events (e.g., Fed rate decisions, crypto halving events).
