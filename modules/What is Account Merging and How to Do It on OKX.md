# What is Account Merging and How to Do It on OKX  

## Understanding Account Merging  

Account merging allows users to consolidate two separate OKX accounts into a single primary account. This process transfers all data, assets, and settings from a secondary account (e.g., Account A) to a primary account (e.g., Account B), after which Account A is permanently closed.  

### Key Scenarios for Merging Accounts  
1. **Updating Contact Information**: If you want to change your registered email or phone number but itâ€™s already linked to another OKX account.  
2. **Consolidating Assets**: Avoid managing multiple accounts by combining cryptocurrency holdings, trading history, and verification documents.

## Critical Notes Before Merging  

### Key Considerations  
- **Primary vs. Secondary Account**: The account youâ€™re logged into becomes the primary account. The secondary account (e.g., the one with the duplicate email/phone number) will be closed.  
- **Account Restrictions**: Accounts with both email and phone number verification cannot be merged.  
- **Asset Transfer**: Ensure all funds and assets are moved out of the secondary account before merging to avoid irreversible losses.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### 1. **Why Canâ€™t I Merge My Accounts?**  
   - If the secondary account has both an email and phone number verified, merging is restricted. Remove one verification method first.  

### 2. **Which Account Becomes the Primary Account?**  
   - The account youâ€™re actively logged into during the merge process retains primary status.  

### 3. **How Long Does Merging Take?**  
   - The process typically completes within minutes, though system maintenance or verification delays may extend this.  

### 4. **What Happens to My Trading History?**  
   - All trading data, transaction records, and KYC information from the secondary account are transferred to the primary account.  

## Benefits of Merging Accounts  

1. **Simplified Management**: Track assets, trades, and rewards in one place.  
2. **Enhanced Security**: Reduce risks associated with managing multiple login credentials.  
3. **Improved Rewards Access**: Consolidate trading volume and holdings to unlock higher-tier benefits.  

## Best Practices for a Smooth Merge  

- **Backup Data**: Export transaction history or wallet addresses from the secondary account before closing it.  
- **Check Verification Status**: Ensure the secondary account only has one verified contact method (email or phone).  
- **Monitor Post-Merge Activity**: Verify that all assets and data appear correctly in the primary account.
