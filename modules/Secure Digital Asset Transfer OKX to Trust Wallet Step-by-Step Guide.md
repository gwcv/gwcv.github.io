## Step-by-Step Transfer Procedure  

### 1. Account Preparation  
Before initiating transfers, ensure both platforms meet basic requirements:  

- **OKX Exchange**: Complete KYC verification for enhanced withdrawal limits  
- **Trust Wallet**: Generate receiving addresses for specific cryptocurrencies  
- **Security Measures**: Enable 2FA on both platforms  

üëâ [OKX's advanced blockchain technology](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus) ensures transaction immutability during this preparation phase.  

### 2. Address Configuration  
Precision in wallet address entry prevents irreversible losses:  

| Cryptocurrency | Receiving Address Format | Network Selection Required |  
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| Bitcoin (BTC)  | 26-35 alphanumeric characters | BTC Network |  
| Ethereum (ETH) | 42-character hexadecimal string | ERC-20 Network |  
| BNB Chain (BNB) | 20-character BSC address | BSC Network |  

### 3. Transaction Execution  
The withdrawal process involves multiple verification layers:  

1. **Amount Specification**: Input transfer quantity considering network fees  
2. **Network Selection**: Choose appropriate blockchain protocol  
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Complete SMS/Google Authenticator challenge  
4. **Transaction Finalization**: Confirm hash ID for tracking purposes
