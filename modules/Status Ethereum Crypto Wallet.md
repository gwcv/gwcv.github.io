## Core Features of Status  

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure Ethereum Wallet  
The Status wallet serves as a multichain gateway for Ethereum-based assets. Users can:  
- **Store** ETH, ERC-20 tokens (e.g., DAI, SNT), and NFTs (ERC-721/1155).  
- **Transact** securely across Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks.  
- **Swap** assets directly via decentralized exchanges (DEXs) integrated into the app.  

Unlike Bitcoin wallets, Status focuses exclusively on Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem, ensuring compatibility with leading DeFi protocols and dApps. Private keys are stored locally, guaranteeing full control over funds.  

> **Pro Tip**: Always verify network fees and recipient addresses before finalizing transactions.

- **Group privacy**: Create encrypted communities with customizable access controls.  

This approach aligns with growing demand for censorship-resistant communication, particularly among Web3-native users.

## Why Choose a Pseudo-Anonymous Wallet?  

Status‚Äôs account creation process requires **no phone number, email, or KYC verification**. Instead:  
1. Generate a wallet seed phrase during onboarding.  
2. Store keys locally on your device (no cloud backups).  
3. Maintain financial sovereignty without compromising privacy.  

This model appeals to users prioritizing anonymity, though it demands diligent seed phrase management to prevent fund loss.
