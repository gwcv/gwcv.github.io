## Understanding the Role of Crypto Wallets

Crypto wallets are essential tools for interacting with blockchain networks, enabling users to store, send, and receive digital currencies. Unlike traditional wallets, they rely on cryptographic keysâ€”**public keys** (similar to bank account numbers) and **private keys** (like secure PINs)â€”to access funds. These wallets also serve as gateways to **decentralized finance (DeFi)** and **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, allowing users to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) seamlessly.

## Security and Trust: A Comparative Analysis

### MetaMask Security

As a non-custodial wallet, MetaMask ensures users retain full control of their private keys. However, its reliance on hot storage (online accessibility) poses risks compared to cold storage solutions. Integration with hardware wallets mitigates this risk by enabling offline key management.

### Coinbase Wallet Security

Coinbase Wallet encrypts private keys locally on the user's device, ensuring Coinbase itself cannot access funds. This design aligns with industry best practices for non-custodial wallets. Additionally, biometric authentication and password-protected browser extensions enhance security.

This focus makes it ideal for users deeply engaged in Ethereum-based projects.

Coinbase Wallet supports over 100,000 cryptocurrencies, including:  
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**

Its built-in dApp browser allows interaction with Ethereum, Polygon, and other blockchain ecosystems.
